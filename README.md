##  About Me
I'm a passionate web developer currently exploring **React**, **Node.js**, and the **modern JavaScript ecosystem**.  
I love building responsive interfaces, understanding how the web works under the hood, and sharing my progress through my [Learning Log](https://github.com/AswinThApa04/Learning-Log).

I believe in *learning by doing* and *building in public*. Every line of code I write moves me closer to mastering the craft.
